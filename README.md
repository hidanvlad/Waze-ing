#Waze-ing: Shortest Path Finder (C++ Implementation) A console application built in C++ to model a transportation network and efficiently calculate the shortest path based on user input for travel time or distance.

1.Key Technologies Used:
-Language: C++
-Algorithm: Dijkstra's Algorithm
-Data Structure: Adjacency List (Graph representation)
-Concepts: Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)

2.Features:
-Calculates the shortest path between a user-defined start node and end node.
-Supports path calculation based on two metrics (e.g., distance and time).
-Loads graph data from an external file (e.g., .txt or .csv).
-Provides clear output of the route taken and the total cost (time/distance).

3.How to Run the Project (Setup/Usage):
-Prerequisites: Requires a C++ compiler (e.g., g++).
-Compilation: Clone the repository and compile using: g++ main.cpp -o waze_app
-Execution: Run the compiled application: ./waze_app
-The application will then prompt the user for the starting node and destination node.
